## Basic Concepts <a id=basic_concepts>

**Git** - Git is an open source tool that allows you to **track changes** in files. It's the fundamental technology that GitHub uses.

**Repository** (**Repo**) - A repository is the basic element of GitHub. You can say it's a **folder** where your project is located. This folder contains all the files of your project and stores the **history of all changes** for each file. You don't have to be the only one with access to the repository, as a repository can have multiple collaborators. A repository can be **public** or **private**.

**Commit** - A commit is a **grouping of changes** in a project. When you commit, Git creates a **unique ID** that allows you to keep records of these changes and also **who** and **when** made the change.

**Organization** - A GitHub Organization is like a profile that **multiple** users have access to. In this organization, you can create repositories.

**Fork** - A fork is a copy of another user's repository that gets saved among your repositories. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project **without affecting the original repository**. However, you can open a **Pull Request** in the original repository.

**Pull Request** - Pull Requests are changes in a repository that a user has proposed and that you as the **owner** (or **collaborator**) of the original repository can **accept** or **reject**.

**Push** - Uploading local changes (not yet on GitHub) that are contained in **commits** to **GitHub**.

**Pull** - Downloading the **current version** of a repository from GitHub. If you've modified some files, a conflict (**Merge Conflict**) may occur, which needs to be resolved.

**Branch** - A branch is a **project branch** that you can add if you want to fix a bug or experiment with something, but don't want it to affect your project. Every repository has a **default branch**, but can contain others as well.

**Merge** - Merge is the **combining** of one branch into another by executing a **Pull Request**.

**Merge Conflict** - This is a state where multiple **newer** versions of a file exist in the code and it's unclear which version should be used.

**License** - A license is an important file that **allows** or **prohibits** you from using other users' code. A license may contain **conditions** and you can legally use code under this license only if you meet them.

**IDE** - *Integrated Development Environment* - is a **development environment** in which you'll work.

**readme.md** - This is a text file containing information about the repository. Since it's automatically displayed **under the repository**, it's usually the first file that a visitor to your repository will see. It's written in **Markdown**.

**.gitignore** - gitignore is a file that specifies which parts shouldn't be uploaded along with changes in a commit. It's used to **filter out unnecessary files**, for example those created by the IDE, or **files with sensitive data**.

> Note: These are just basic concepts. We recommend reading the glossary from GitHub's official documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary

## Creating a Repository <a id=creating_repository>

1. In the upper right corner, click **+** and click **New Repository**.

![img1](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/newrepo1.png "New repo")

2. Name your repository, you can also add a description, **readme** file, **.gitignore**, **license** or change the repository to **private**. Then click **Create Repository**.

![img2](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/newrepo2.png "New repo")

## Setup / Committing from Visual Studio <a id=commit_vs>

### Repository Setup

After installing Visual Studio, you must synchronize your GitHub repository so you can create commits from it.

1. After opening Visual Studio, choose **Clone a repository**, which is located in the right part of the window.

![imgvs1](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/vs/1.png "vs")

2. Here choose **GitHub**.

![imgvs2](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/vs/2.png "vs")

3. A window will pop up where you can log in by clicking **Sign in...** in the upper right part.

![imgvs3](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/vs/3.png "vs")

![imgvs4](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/vs/4.png "vs")

4. After successful login, Visual Studio will make your repositories available.

![imgvs5](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/vs/5.png "vs")

After selecting one of the repositories, it will download and you can edit it or use it otherwise.

### Committing

After editing files, you must commit the changes.

1. After editing the project, Visual Studio will show how many changes were made. Click on the pencil in the lower right corner with a number (the number symbolizes how many files were changed), and the **GIT panel** will open.

![imgvs6](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/vs/6.png "vs")

2. Write a description of the commit and press **Commit All**.

![imgvs7](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/vs/7.png "vs")

![imgvs8](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/vs/8.png "vs")

3. Notice that Visual Studio says the commit was created locally - this means it's not yet in your repository on GitHub, but only on your computer. If you want to put it on GitHub, click **Push**, and Visual Studio will push it to GitHub.

![imgvs9](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/vs/9.png "vs")

![imgvs10](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/vs/10.png "vs")

### Downloading Changes from GitHub / Fetch

Changes that were made in the repository by someone else won't download automatically, you must first **fetch** them and then **pull** them.

1. In the Git panel, click **Fetch**.

![imgvs11](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/vs/11.png "vs")

2. Visual Studio will then show you how many commits need to be downloaded so you have the most current version of the repository:

![imgvs12](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/vs/12.png "vs")

3. Click on the **number of changes** and then on **Pull**.

![imgvs13](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/vs/13.png "vs")

## Setup / Committing from GitHub Desktop <a id=github_desktop>

Unlike other **IDEs**, GitHub Desktop is a stand-alone GIT client, which means it doesn't have IDE elements (Compiler, code editor, ...) but is intended only for committing and other GIT operations.

### Repository Setup
After installing GitHub Desktop, you must synchronize your GitHub repository so you can commit from it.

1. On the left, click **Clone a repository from the Internet**
2. Then choose **GitHub.com** and click **Sign In**. Then in the security warning window, click **Continue with browser**.

![img_gh1](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/ghd/1.png "ghd")

![img_gh2](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/ghd/2.png "ghd")

![img_gh3](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/ghd/3.png "ghd")

4. In the browser, log into GitHub (if you're not already) and click **Authorize desktop**.

![img_gh4](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/ghd/4.png "ghd")

6. Your repositories will be displayed on the right. Choose the correct one and click **Clone [repository name]**. Choose where you want to save it and click **Clone**.

![img_gh5](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/ghd/5.png "ghd")

![img_gh6](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/ghd/6.png "ghd")

![img_gh7](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/ghd/7.png "ghd")

8. Your repository has just been cloned and you can start working.

![img_gh8](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/ghd/8.png "ghd")

### Committing
After editing files, you need to make a **commit**. GitHub Desktop automatically tracks changes in files and displays them on the panel in the left part with each change.

1. In the lower left corner, write the commit name and optionally description, then click **Commit to master**.

![img_gh9](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/ghd/9.png "ghd")

2. Notice that your commit is not yet on GitHub, and GitHub Desktop says that one (or more) commits are available that haven't been **pushed** to GitHub yet - this means these commits are not yet in your repository on GitHub, but only on your computer. If you want to put them on GitHub, click **Push origin**, and GitHub Desktop will automatically push them to GitHub.

![img_gh10](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/ghd/10.png "ghd")

### Downloading Changes from GitHub / Fetch
Changes that were made in the repository by someone else won't download automatically, you must first **fetch** them and then **pull** them.

1. On the top panel, click **Fetch Origin**. This will check the state of the repository and whether a newer commit is available.

![img_gh11](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/ghd/11.png "ghd")

2. If a newer commit is available, you'll see the option to **pull** changes. Pull them by clicking **Pull origin**.

![img_gh12](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/ghd/12.png "ghd")

## Setup / Committing from JetBrains Rider <a id=commit_rider>

### Repository Setup

After installing JetBrains Rider, you must synchronize your GitHub repository so you can commit from it.

1. After opening JetBrains Rider, choose **Get from VCS**.

![imgrd1](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/rider/1.png "rider")

2. After opening a new window, check if Rider recognizes Git in the system. If you see **Git is not installed**, click **Download and install** and wait for the process to finish (it may take a few minutes).

![imgrd2](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/rider/2.png "rider")

3. On the left in the menu, click **GitHub** and then **Log in via GitHub...**, which will open a web browser. Click the **Authorize in GitHub** button, log in, and after successful login, you'll see that you've successfully logged into GitHub and can close the tab.

![imgrd3](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/rider/3.png "rider")

![imgrd4](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/rider/4.png "rider")

![imgrd5](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/rider/5.png "rider")

![imgrd6](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/rider/6.png "rider")

4. After successful login, Rider will offer your repositories for download:

![imgrd7](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/rider/7.png "rider")

5. Click the **Clone** button - The repository will automatically download and you can use it.

### Committing

After editing files, you need to make a **commit**.

1. In the upper right corner, you see **GIT** menu icons. For committing, click the green checkmark.

![imgrd7](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/rider/11.png "rider")

2. A menu will open on the left showing changed files. Write a commit description at the bottom and click **Commit and Push**.

![imgrd7](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/rider/12.png "rider")

3. This step is only necessary after the **first commit** from a new **IDE**: Git needs your information for the first run. Enter the information and then click **Set and commit**.

![imgrd7](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/rider/13.png "rider")

4. A window will appear summarizing what changes you're about to make. Click the **Push** button and Rider will upload the changes directly to GitHub.

![imgrd7](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/rider/14.png "rider")

### Downloading Changes from GitHub / Fetch

Changes that were made in the repository by someone else won't download automatically, you must first **fetch** them and then **pull** them.

1. In the GIT panel, click the blue arrow pointing down.

![imgrd7](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/rider/16.png "rider")

2. After clicking, choose **Merge incoming changes into current branch**.

![imgrd7](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/rider/17.png "rider")

## Setup / Committing from Terminal <a id=commit_cmd>

### Setup
1. Download **GIT** (installation guide is available on [their website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)).
2. Configure your **name** and **email**.
```
$ git config --global user.name "Your Github Login"
$ git config --global user.email "your_email@something.something"
```
3. **Initialize** a Git repository in the folder. This command creates a new so-called local repository. Local repositories store changes only on your computer.
```
$ git init
```

If you want to use GitHub, you must add it as a remote origin. Remote origin is a repository that will be synchronized with your local one. This means you'll be able to pull changes made on GitHub (as remote), and push changes made in the local repository. However, this process is automated, so you just need to execute commands from the Committing and Downloading changes from GitHub sections. If you want to add your repo as remote, execute the following command, just change the URL address:
```
$ git remote add origin "https://github.com/github_login/repository_name.git"
```

3. Set the **branch** you want to work in (usually `main` or `master`).
```
$ git branch -M main
```
### Committing
1. Select all **changes** you want to **upload**.
```
$ git add <changed_file>
```
or, if you want to upload **all files**:
```
$ git add .
```
2. **Commit** changes with an appropriate **description** of changes.
```
$ git commit -m "this is a commit description"
```
3. **Push** committed changes to GitHub.
```
$ git push
```
### Downloading Changes from GitHub / Fetch
1. If you want to **only get information** about the **current version** of the remote repository, execute:
```
$ git fetch
```
2. If you want to **download them afterwards**, use:
```
$ git pull
```

## Writing documentation <a id=docs>
Documentation is an important part of every project. It helps users understand how to use your project and also helps other developers understand how your code works. Github allows you to write documentation in a simple way using **Markdown**. 

If you create file called readme.md in the root of your repository, it will be automatically displayed under the repository name (this repository is a good example, as you can see markdown source of this file by looking at readme.md file in this repository): 

> TIP: Creating a repository with same name as your GitHub username will create a special repository, whose readme.md file will be displayed on your profile page. For example, if your username is `johnDoe`, create a repository called `johnDoe`.

![img_docs1](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/docs.jpg "docs")

Markdown is a simple way to format text. You can create headings, lists, links, images, and more. Here are some basic examples:

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

**Bold text**

*Italic text*

- List item 1
- List item 2

[Link text](https://example.com)

![Image alt text](https://picsum.photos/200/200)

```
This will be rendered as:
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

**Bold text**

*Italic text*

- List item 1
- List item 2

[Link text](https://example.com)

![Image alt text](https://picsum.photos/200/200)


For more information on Markdown, you can refer to the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

> TIP: You can also use [this](https://stackedit.io/app#) online editor to write and preview your Markdown files. Then you can copy the text to your readme.md file.

Github also allows you to have multiple markdown files in your repository, but they're not automatically displayed (user has to manually click on them in repo). You can create a `docs` folder and put all your documentation files there. You can then link to these files from your readme.md file.


### Github Pages
GitHub Pages is a feature that allows you to host a website directly from your GitHub repository. It's a great way to publish documentation or a personal portfolio using just Markdown files.

To get started, create a special repository named `<your-username>.github.io`. The content of this repository's `main` branch will be automatically published as a website.

You can simply create an `index.md` or `README.md` file with Markdown content. For example, adding a file with `# Hello World` will create a homepage with that heading at `https://<your-username>.github.io`.

By default, GitHub Pages uses Jekyll to convert your Markdown files into a static website. You can customize the look and feel with themes and even configure different Markdown processors.

For more information on configuring your site, check out the official documentation on [setting a Markdown processor for your GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/setting-a-markdown-processor-for-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll).


## Collaboration between Classmates <a id=collaboration>

You're in a team with a classmate and you need to work on a project together, but you don't want each of you to have your own repository, you want to work on one. In that case, you can add your classmate as a collaborator to your repository.

1. Go to **repository settings**.

![img3](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/privrep1.png "settings")

2. Click **Manage Access** (May require re-login).

![img4](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/privrep2.png "settings")

3. Click **Invite a collaborator**.

![img5](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/privrep4.png "settings")

4. Search for your classmate and add them.

![img6](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/privrep5.png "settings")

![img7](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/privrep6.png "settings")

![img8](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/privrep7.png "settings")

![img9](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/privrep8.png "settings")

5. Your classmate will then receive an invitation to their email address, which they will accept.

![img10](https://github.com/SPSKNM-cvicenia/Github-Introduction/blob/main/uploads/privrepo8.png "settings")
